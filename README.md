KNN algorithm can be used for both classification and regression problems. It uses feature similarity to predict the values of any new data points. This means that the new entity  is assigned a value based on how closely it resembles the points in the training set.

KNN works because of the deeply rooted mathematical theories it uses. When implementing KNN, the first step is to transform data points into feature vectors, or their mathematical value. The algorithm then works by finding the distance between the mathematical values of these points. 

Our goal is using Generalized feature extraction for structural pattern recognition in time-series data extracted from “Carnegie Mellon University”. Using the k-nearest neighbors’ method, find the model that provides the best accuracy based on the various p and k values to classify two classes of normal heartbeat and Myocardial Infarction.
